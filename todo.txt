[ ] add option to filter by name
[x] have each pool have all info (start, end, location, name, open length, distance to you, driving time...) stored in like a card
	[ ] display cards vertically on phone, and maybe in a grid on pc
		This looks good? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap
	[ ] easy to sort like this, instead of a fricking table
	[ ] distance     fills in once you put in your coordinates
	[ ] driving time fills in once you put in your API key
[ ] change it to store data in JS, then give them stuff by date. Don't want them having a large DOM the whole time, it's "laggy" (and inefficient to store, unlike js).
[ ] get gmaps API key working
[ ] save coordinates for each location (programatically)
[ ] add an option to plug in your coordinates, then it sorts them by distance
[ ] add an option to plug in your address + API key, and it checks driving time to each location

[ ] bootstrap the mf up!
